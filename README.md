# Fraudulent-Job-Posting-Prediction-
The rise of fraudulent job postings has become a significant threat in the online job market, with thousands of job seekers falling victim to scams each year. Traditional fraud detection methods, which rely on manual moderation and user reports, are slow, inefficient, and unable to scale with the increasing volume of job listings. This inefficiency leaves platforms such as LinkedIn, Indeed, and Glassdoor vulnerable to deceptive job postings that exploit unsuspecting applicants. 
 Employed Logistic Regression and Random Forest as our primary classification models, predicting fraudulent listings based on key features such as job descriptions, telecommuting status, company logos, and screening questions. Additionally integrated Word2Vec for contextual embedding, enabling the model to detect patterns and similarities among fraudulent job postings beyond simple keyword matching.
